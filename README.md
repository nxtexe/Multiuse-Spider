# Multiuse-Spider
A scraping algorithm that extracts all tags from a website and organizes the tags and their attributes in a dictionary. The implementation is written in python, long, repetitive, inefficient and could be done better but it does the job quite well in a short amount of time and works with any website it can get through to. Enjoy :)
